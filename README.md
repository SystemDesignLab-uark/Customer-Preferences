There are 3-Phases to perform data analysis on the 3DHubs website.
The first is to collect the "Hub" links from each city using the ExtractLinks.py program and paste them into a .txt file.
Following this the dataCollection.py program runs to collect specific data from each Hubs link and paste it into an Excel
file. Finally the Visual Basic Macros are ran to transform the data collected into an organized table for analysis.
